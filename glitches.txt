Glitches with the site:
- Set rates is backwards for admins
- when tutors try to add a class that the admin needs to accept alert needs to change
- 1Tutors clicking on accept request or decline request don't get redirected.
- If tutor doesn't have WePay account, the Pay Now button still shows
- When admins click on accept class button, the page doesn't redirect.


- when I(Jon So) try to request adding a class as a tutor or student no classes show up

- mytutees.html shows tutor's information.
