Touhey's Notes:
Student Group should actually be a user. This user will have a studentgroupname.

class Users(ndb.Model):
	...
	studentgroupname = ndb.StringProperty() #if empty, this user is NOT a student group.

class Appointments(ndb.Model):
	...
	studentgroupname = ndb.StringProperty() #if empty, the student will be paying instead.

class StudentGroupRequests(ndb.Model):
	student = ndb.IntegerProperty() #links to User
	groupname = ndb.StringProperty() #links to User.studentgroupname

class StudentGroups (ndb.Model):
	student = ndb.IntegerProperty() #links to User
	groupname = ndb.StringProperty() #links to User.studentgroupname

Student must make a request to be in a student group.
Student Group must approve student to be in the list.

Under student's Pay button, they should be able to request to have a student group pay.
If you have selected a student group to pay, it dissapears from the student's list.
